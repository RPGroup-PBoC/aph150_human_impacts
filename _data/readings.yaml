       Each year Nicholas Kristof ends the year with his assessment of how we are
       doing. His articles are an interesting reminder of the different sides of
       the ledger seat on humans, their impacts and their own well being.

       This article gives an indication of the difficulty of our topic. Even
       questions about facts spawn indignation. We will try to be cognizant of the
       ways in which political vision insinuates itself into discussions of
       facts.

      This is a model for how I want us to assemble our data
      on all the key numbers we examine in the context of human impacts.
      We should have a HIID (Human Impact Identification Number),
      an explanation of the value, how it was measured, quote the original
      source where the number was reported and if possible, comment
      decisively on the uncertainty.
