    description: >
      **Required Reading**: The domestication of dogs was the first
      real example of human domestication of either plants or animals.
      There is a vast and wonderful literature on this subject that
      draws from archaeology and modern DNA science.  The story of
      Greger Larson will be one of our main touch points and
      this article by Ed Yong puts the latest research in perspective.

    authors: J. A. J. Gowlett. 
    year: 2016
    link: Gowlett_2016.pdf
    description: >
      **Required Reading**: This article
      traces our understanding of the use of fire by our ancestors, with very solid
      evidence going back some 400,000 years and plausible arguments going as far
      back as 2 million years. One of the most interesting things I learned from
      this article was about the use of fire without really being able to control
      when and where it would start.

    year: 2013
    description: > 
      **Required Reading**: This website gives an overview of some of the issues surrounding soil
      degradation and agriculture. One of the claims made here that I have
      now heard more than once this week talking to the professionals in the
      field is that humans have become a great agent moving around earth:
      "Natural erosional processes occur most intensively in mountainous
      regions (Figure 2) and generate approximately 20 gigatons of sediment
      annually (Wilkinson and McElroy 2006). In comparison, human geomorphic
      activities, principally agriculture, construction and mining mostly
      occur at lower elevations and annually move more than 100 gigatons of
      earth materials (Hooke 2000). Humanity has surpassed the timeless
      contest between uplift and erosion as the dominant agent of geomorphic
      change."

      introductory videos </a> (and try to be in a receptive mood just to learn
      about the range of views out there). In general, this course acknowledges the
      difference between ignorance and skepticism and as I told you at the
      beginning, our first order of business is to try and get our facts as
      straight as we can without coming to those facts with an agenda. Then, it
      would be great to start noting the different hypotheses set forth to explain
      the facts that have been settled.
