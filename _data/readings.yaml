       **Required Reading**: Each year Nicholas Kristof ends the year with his assessment of how we are
       doing. His articles are an interesting reminder of the different sides of
       the ledger seat on humans, their impacts and their own well being.

       **Required Reading**: This article gives an indication of the difficulty of our topic. Even
       questions about facts spawn indignation. We will try to be cognizant of the

    description: >
      **Required Reading**: This is a model for how I want us to assemble our data
      on all the key numbers we examine in the context of human impacts.
      We should have a HIID (Human Impact Identification Number),
      an explanation of the value, how it was measured, quote the original
      source where the number was reported and if possible, comment
      decisively on the uncertainty.

      **Required Reading**: This paper takes a deep dive into quantifying the biomass of our planet. To 
      reach our conclusions, we carefully reviewed myriad data sets related to the

    title: "The Origin of Dogs: When, Where, and How Many Times Were They Domesticated?"
    authors: Ed Yong at The Atlantic.

    link_type: external
    link: "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/the-origin-of-dogs/484976/"
    description: >
      **Required Reading**: The domestication of dogs was the first
      real example of human domestication of either plants or animals.
      There is a vast and wonderful literature on this subject that
      draws from archaeology and modern DNA science.  The story of
      Greger Larson will be one of our main touch points and
      this article by Ed Yong puts the latest research in perspective.

    description: > 
      **Recommended Reading**: Fueled by advances in analyzing DNA from the bones of
      ancient humans, scientists have dramatically expanded the number of samples
      studied -- revealing vast and surprising migrations and genetic mixing of
      populations in our prehistoric past.

    authors: J. A. J. Gowlett. 
    year: 2016
    link: Gowlett_2016.pdf
    description: >
      **Required Reading**: This article
      traces our understanding of the use of fire by our ancestors, with very solid
      evidence going back some 400,000 years and plausible arguments going as far
      back as 2 million years. One of the most interesting things I learned from
      this article was about the use of fire without really being able to control
      when and where it would start.

    year: 2013
    description: > 
      **Required Reading**: This website gives an overview of some of the issues surrounding soil
      degradation and agriculture. One of the claims made here that I have
      now heard more than once this week talking to the professionals in the
      field is that humans have become a great agent moving around earth:
      "Natural erosional processes occur most intensively in mountainous
      regions (Figure 2) and generate approximately 20 gigatons of sediment
      annually (Wilkinson and McElroy 2006). In comparison, human geomorphic
      activities, principally agriculture, construction and mining mostly
      occur at lower elevations and annually move more than 100 gigatons of
      earth materials (Hooke 2000). Humanity has surpassed the timeless
      contest between uplift and erosion as the dominant agent of geomorphic
      change."
