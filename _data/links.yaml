    This is one of the most important questions we will address in this
    course is how to judge different data sources, whether about the number
    of proteins in a bacterium or the number of sharks killed each year to
    make shark fin soup. This website will serve as a jumping off point for
    some of our studies.

    Here is one example of a vignette from "Cell Biology by the Numbers" which
    presents a question, a succinct bit of background, and an estimate. We hope
    to see your vignettes be made in the same style, though submitted as a PDF.

    A timely vignette from "Cell Biology by the Numbers" where a simple estimate
    of a viral burst size is made.
