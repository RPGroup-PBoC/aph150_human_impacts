      **Recommended Viewing**: Greger Larson is one of the principal
      figures thinking about the domestication of dogs. This excellent podcast
      explains the special relationship humans have with their canine partners. One
      of the most interesting hypotheses described here is that wolves
      self-domesticated.

      **Recommended Viewing**: A superb NPR video on the
      domestication of dogs. One of the most amazing parts of this video is when
      they travel the long running (60 year) experiment on domesticating foxes and
      high artificial selection on behavior had the unintended side effect of
      producing foxes with white chests, floppy ears and wagging, curled tails.
