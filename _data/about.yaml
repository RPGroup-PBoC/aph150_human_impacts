  The Great Human Experiment by the Numbers 

Summary: >
  The greatest experiment of the last 10,000 years is the presence and action
  of modern human beings on planet Earth. At this point, the consequences of
  this experiment are being felt on many fronts. Yet, many people still hold
  the view that because the world is so “huge”, humans cannot really make a
  substantial impact. One way to organize our thinking about what these impacts
  might be, with tongue in cheek, is to focus on Empedocles’s classic elements,
  earth, air, water and fire, with the idea being to explore how humans have
  altered the land and its inhabitants, the atmosphere, the oceans and how our
  quest for cheaper and cheaper energy (fire) from the world around us has
  altered that world. In this course, we will explore and establish a
  definitive series of resources on Human Impacts by the Numbers and make
  quantitative, back-of-the-envelope estimations of our impact.


Meeting: >
  We will meet once as a week on Wednesdays from 4pm to 6pm PST for a lecture and
  discussion about various topics. Due to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and
  the California Shelter-In-Place order, the meetings will occur via the
  [Zoom video conferencing service](https://zoom.us/). Auditors are welcome
  to join the class. Email Griffin (gchure [at] caltech [dot] edu) for the
  Zoom meeting link. **You may NOT share the link outside the course without
  instructor permission.**

Course Policies: >
  This course will meet once a week with mandatory attendance (or by listening
  the lectures after class). The course grade will be based upon two
  activities: every student will construct a single "by the numbers" vignette
  that features a key questions about human impacts (needs to be approved by
  instructors), an estimate of what sets the scale of the human impact of
  interest, a dimensionless ratio that characterizes the magnitude of the
  effect, a well curated spreadsheet providing the data on the topic of
  interest and a written several page "vignette" that tells the story of that
  human impact. In addition, every student will give a presentation to the
  rest of the class during the last week of the class. Collaboration is
  strongly encouraged. As a class, we will also develop a one page "key
  numbers on human impacts" that captures 25 of the most important human
  impact numbers we can think of. However, for the individual human impact
  numbers, every student needs to turn in their own original contribution.
  There will also be several homeworks that will be graded by students within
  the class.

Course GitHub: > 
  During the course, you will scour the internet for reputable sources of key
  numbers necessary to either perform or sanity-check our estimates. It is
  important that we keep a detailed ledger of our data sets, sources, and
  potential biases they may have. To that end, we will be using a
  [repository](http://github.com/rpgroup-pboc/aph150_2020) hosted by
  [GitHub](http://github.com). Please set up an account on GitHub (if you don't
  have one already) and send your username information to Griffin (gchure [at]
  caltech [dot] edu) and we will grant you access to the repository.
