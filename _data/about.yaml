  The Great Human Experiment by the Numbers 

Summary: >
  The greatest experiment of the last 10,000 years is the presence and action
  of modern human beings on planet Earth. At this point, the consequences of
  this experiment are being felt on many fronts. Yet, many people still hold
  the view that because the world is so “huge”, humans cannot really make a
  substantial impact. One way to organize our thinking about what these impacts
  might be, with tongue in cheek, is to focus on Empedocles’s classic elements,
  earth, air, water and fire, with the idea being to explore how humans have
  altered the land and its inhabitants, the atmosphere, the oceans and how our
  quest for cheaper and cheaper energy (fire) from the world around us has
  altered that world. In this course, we will explore and establish a
  definitive series of resources on Human Impacts by the Numbers and make
  quantitative, back-of-the-envelope estimations of our impact.
